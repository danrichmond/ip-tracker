I developed this IP tracker to acquire geographical information about a given IP address for use in a larger scale security application. It utilizes Selenium to gather the information from ip-tracker.org.

Getting up and running:
  Clone the repo locally.
  Import the repo into Eclipse.
  Right click on the project, hover over Build Path, then click on Configure Build Path...
  Click Libraries
  Click Add External JARS...
  Navigate to the libs director and select all of the .jar files
  Click Open
  Click Apply and Close
  Now run the application and look for the details in the output!
